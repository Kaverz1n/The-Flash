# THE FLASH

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Flash is a handy Telegram bot created specifically for users who want to purchase original
goods from POIZON (DEWU) marketplace with minimal effort and maximum comfort. It offers a simple
and fast checkout process for any product presented on the platform.

An important feature of the bot is its handy calculator, which allows users to easily and
accurately calculate the cost of goods in rubles, based on the prices in Chinese yuan.
This greatly simplifies shopping for Russian users by providing them with transparent
information about the cost of goods.

In addition, THE FLASH offers a unique profile feature that allows users to enter their
information just once. They can then easily use this information when placing orders,
without having to re-enter their data.

This project also includes a full-featured administration panel that provides administrators
with convenient order and user management, as well as technical support tools to ensure a
quick response to any queries or questions.

Extensive validation of all data entered by users is an integral part of the project.
It helps avoid unforeseen errors and ensures safety and security for everyone involved
in the purchasing process.
